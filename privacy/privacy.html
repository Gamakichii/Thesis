  <title>Privacy Policy - Facebook Phishing Detection Extension</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This browser extension is designed to detect and flag potentially malicious or phishing links on Facebook posts.</p>
  
  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> The extension analyzes text and links on Facebook pages to identify suspicious or malicious links. This analysis happens locally on your device. No data is sent to external servers.</li>
    <li><strong>User Activity:</strong> The extension observes when you navigate between Facebook pages to re-run phishing detection. No clicks, keystrokes, or personal browsing history are recorded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>All processing is performed locally in your browser. The extension does not collect, store, or share your personal data. Detected phishing links are blurred in real time, and you have full control to unblur content.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No personal information is shared with third parties. This extension does not track users across sites and does not transmit data outside of your device.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
  <p>Permissions requested (activeTab, scripting, storage, webNavigation, tabs, host access to facebook.com) are strictly required for the extensionâ€™s single purpose: detecting phishing links on Facebook.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, you may contact us at: <em>[your email here]</em></p>
